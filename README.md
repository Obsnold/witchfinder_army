# Witchfinder Army
  
This game was originally made for the Board Game Geek Anual 9 Card competition 2021.  
Since then I have changed the art work and modified the rules.
The gameplay is similar to Mafia/Werewolf.  

## Goal
Witches and Cultist have infiltrated the witchfinder army!  
The witches and cultists want to kill all the cultists so that they can cummon their dark lord!  
The witchfinders wish to kill all the witches without accidentally killing all the cultists!  

## Setup
  * Remove the ghost cards and witchfinder general cards from the deck.
  * Deal one card to each player.
  * Every player must then close their eyes
  * First the witches open their eyes and identify each other (maybe use a 30 second timer)
  * Witches then close their eyes
  * Then the cultists open their eyes and identify each other
  * Cultists then close their eyes
  * Everyone opens their eyes

## Rules
  * People can then be nominated for witchfinder general
  * People then vote for withcfinder general.
  * The witchfinder general then takes office and the witchfinder general card.
  * They may then execture one person.
  * That person is given a ghost card and is then dead.
  * Ghosts can look at one other players card without showing it to anyone else.
  * Ghosts cannot vote.
  * If someone wishes to challenge the current witchfinder general they can ask for a vote of no confidence at which point new witchfinder general are nominated and another one is voted in.
  * The old witchfinder general cannot immediatley rerun for office.
  * Play continues like this until either all the witches are dead or all the cultists are dead.


## One Night Variant.
Only one election and one execution can happen  
instead of all cultists being executed or all witches only one of either needs to be executed.
