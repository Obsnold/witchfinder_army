remove the ghost cards and witchfinder general cards from the deck.
deal one card to each player.
every player must then close their eyes
first the witches identify each other
then the cultists identify each other
everyone opens their eyes
people can then be nominated for witchfinder general
people then vote for withcfinder general.
the witchfinder general then takes office and the witchfinder general card.
They may then execture one person.
That person is given a ghost card and is then dead.
Ghosts can look at one other players card.
ghosts cannot vote.
if someone wishes to challenge the current witchfinder general they can ask for a vote of no confidence at which point new witchfinder general are nominated and another one is voted in.
The old witchfinder general cannot immediatley rerun for office.
play continues like this until either all the witches are dead or all the cultists are dead.


One Night Variant.
Only one election and one execution can happen
instead of all cultists being executed or all witches only one of either needs to be executed.
